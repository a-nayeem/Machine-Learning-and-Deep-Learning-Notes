
## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning can be defined in many ways. One simple and informal way to define ML is "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

Let's consider, 
Performance of a program = P
Class of Tasks = T
Experience = E

In another formal and modern definition, Tom Mitchell describes ML as using Experience(E) to improve performance of the program (P) for a class of task T.

Learning can be divided into different categories depending on type of data being used for learning. These categories are:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
